            <h2><center>Welcome to Internet Programming</center></h2>
            <h4><center>Introduction to the Internet</center></h4>
            <p>The Internet was created about 40 years ago with the simple objective of allowing disparate computers to communicate with each other. 
            Today, the Internet has grown into a vast resource for information and communication. It is the single largest network of computers with 
            a host of available services. Other types of networks include intranets and extranets. An intranet utilizes the same protocols as the Internet
            and provides many of the same services, such as e-mail and Web pages. However, an intranet is for use within an organization and access to the
            information on an Intranet is restricted to the employees of a given organization.  An extranet is a company intranet that is accessible to users
            outside the company, such as vendors, customers, and suppliers. Because part of the intranet is made available to users outside the company, an 
            extranet requires special security measures</p>
            <h4><center>Architecture of the Internet</center></h4>
            <p>The Internet is a network of computers with clients and servers. The primary function of the Internet is to route the network traffic between
            computers. When you connect to the Internet, your computer is only aware of the nodes that are close to it. For example, when you try connecting to the Microsoft
            site, your computer does not know which path on the Internet will connect your computer to the Microsoft site. Instead, your computer knows which is its closest
            gateway and forwards the request to it. This gateway might not be able to connect your computer to the Microsoft site, but it can forward the request to another 
            gateway that does. Gateways are network points that perform the function of an entrance to another network. Gateways involve the use of routers. A router 
            determines the next network point to which a packet, or block of data, should be forwarded towards its destination. A router is connected to two networks and 
            selects a route to send information. The choice is based on its current understanding of the state of the networks to which it is connected. If your machine is 
            unable to connect to the Internet, the problem may be that it does not know a gateway to which it can send the request</p>
            <h4><center>Protocols</center></h4>
            <p>A protocol is a set of communication rules. It is a set of standards that ensures various network programs work together. Protocols exist at several levels
             in a telecommunication connection. There are three Internet protocols: - TCP/IP - HTTP - FTP</p>
